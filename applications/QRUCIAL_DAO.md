## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

TBAra33it0 >> If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Qrucial-DAO is a system for trustless audits, and certifica-
tion using non-transferable NFTs,exogenous tooling and decentralized Consensus.

TBAsix - An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

- To us, it is ironic that web3 and trustless systems are trusting
web2 auditors and legacy security companies to protect
them from threat actors. This is the reason we want to build
a system in which the community and the projects can trust
that a security assessment has in fact has been done in a professional manner.
To often, security audits
of web3 projects are performed in a way that relies on intransparency and blind trust in a company logo instead of a proof of computation as well as a proof that the auditor is knowledgeble of the task at hand.
It seems that many auditing companys are not in security but the pdf business.
We want to change this.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- QDAO is a multichain solution which brings security services
and tools to the blockchain. Such services include automa-
ted smart contract audits and tools like symbolic analyzers.
We are the first connecting defensive as well as offensive
security tool execution to the blockchain.
A Web3 Security Toolkit is to be built, and the tools inside
will be executable on QDAO nodes. In the beginning, we will
be focusing on auditing tools.
The tooling itself is bundled in a container and is being deve-
loped and maintained and voted on by qrucial and the DAO
though the nominated proof of stake governance system.
The distribution of the containers is done through decentra-
lized means.
Runtime upgrades are used to update the toolbox on each
node.

- TBAsix >> Topology TBA
- Research and meeting notes to be added and their results
- An overview of the technology stack to be used

Core components include Substrate, the main Q

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

TBAsix >>
Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

### Team's experience

QRUCIAL OÜ is a web3 security company.

This is the first time we apply for a grant.

Six aka David Pethes is a web3 researcher and security expert and founded the largest crypto hacking competition in the world – CCTF – two years ago. He has more than 9 years experience in IT penetration testing and got several global certifications. Since 2021 he is Regional Head Ambassador for Eastern Europe of Polkadot. Since 2013 he is into blockchain and keeps improving his skills through related projects since then.

ra33it0 aka Sebastian Kraus is the founder and strategic mind behind a multitude of companies. His activities range from Carbon neutral real estate with OLYMP to Crypto-Marketing with Elfzntrollz and information security QRUCIAL aiming to make Web3 more secure.
Back in 2016, he became interested in blockchain and hacking and has since refined his skills in the field.

Wigy is an ex-Parity substrate developer. He is proficient in coding in Rust.

Silur is working at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) as cryptographer, was an early Ethereum developer and still works on cryptocurrency projects.

knockoff is linux system administrator and junior rust developer.

## Development Status :open_book:

TBAra33it0 >>
If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

TBAsix >>
For each milestone,
- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

## Future Plans

TBAra33it0 >>
Please include here
- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

- In the short term we'd like to have the grant so development goes faster. QRUCIAL as a company will keep funding the project until it becomes self-sustaining (meaning, the governance system keeps the DAO running on its own).
- CCTF (cryptoctf.org) is already a partner, helping to bring the best web3 hackers to the system.
- Elfz and Trollz is a marketing partner so we don't just develop a DAO, but also make it usable and visually acceptable to all audiences.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Personal recommendation from Achim Schneider and Jonan.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- We already have the litepaper: TBA link
- QRUCIAL OÜ is paying for the development already.
- This is the first time we request a grant.
